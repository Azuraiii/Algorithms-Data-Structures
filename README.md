# Algorithms-Data-Structures
This repository will contain the algorithms I am learning. Initially written in Java but hope to have them C and Python also in the long term.
This is a new repository.

Current Algorithms:

1.Heap Data Structure
2.Levenshtein EDDIT Distance Algorithm.
3.Algorithm to check if characters in a string are unique.
